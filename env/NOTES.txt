DISCLAIMER:
Before this, there were 2 videos, about installing python and
basic terminologies. I didn't take notes of it because it was simple.

SECTION 1
3.0 Writing Our First Program
--> Just basic input, output. input= user's name&age, output= user's
    name&age
--> The lecturer made a joke on his age (he's old aww)
--> Execution starts from the top and goes down
--> Indentation. "Users can ignore the spaces", but tbh we all know,
    identation must be taken care of, kan?
--> Comment must explain what code is going/trying
    to do.
--> Explanation on basic commands and how to use:
    print(), len(), str()
--> Explanation about calling functions and what functions are
    briefly. ELI5 style
--> Thorough explanation on how code is compiled

SECTION 2
1.0 Flow Charts and Basic Flow Control Concepts
--> Ahhhh yes, flow charts! Conditions. Decision-making.
--> Representation of 'Yes/No' in coding: Boolean values, Comparison
    operators and Boolean operators
--> Truth tables~

2.0 if, else, elif statements
--> explanation on if statements; has a condition, and only executes code
    if the condition is met
--> else statement is executed when if statement is false
--> elif statement: if else statement
--> input() and how to use it in if else statement

3.0 while loops
--> while loop runs the code in its block over and over again until its condition is false
--> the classic bug: infinite loop~~~
--> break statements: immediately leave loop, without re-checking condition
--> continue statements: execution immeidately jump back to the start of the
    loop and re-check condition

4.0 for loops
--> runs a block code for a specific run of times
--> range for loop function can be called with three arguments:
    start values, end values, step argument
--> step argument: number of variable increase/decrease after iteration
--> can use -ve numbers
